# Firecrawl Market Research

Use this for sourced market and financial research.

## Onboarding Interview

Infer the market/company, data focus, timeframe, and output format from context. If the research target is clear, proceed immediately.

Ask at most 1-3 concise questions only if blocked, such as the market/company, required data focus, or timeframe/geography.

## Firecrawl Collection Plan

Use Firecrawl search and scrape for market reports, news, investor relations, SEC filings, and company pages. Use browser where charts, tabs, period selectors, or financial portals require interaction.

Common sources include company investor relations pages, SEC filings, financial portals, earnings releases, industry reports, and news.

## Parallel Work

If appropriate, use sub-agents or equivalent parallel task runners:

- company financials
- market metrics
- industry trends
- recent news and analyst commentary
- source validation
