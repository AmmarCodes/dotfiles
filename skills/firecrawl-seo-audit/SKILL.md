# Firecrawl SEO Audit

Use this to turn a website into a specific, prioritized SEO audit.

## Onboarding Interview

Infer the site, target keywords, and output format from context. If the site is clear, proceed immediately.

Ask at most 1-3 concise questions only if blocked, such as the site URL, required target keywords, or whether a specific page/competitor set matters.

## Firecrawl Collection Plan

1. Map the site with Firecrawl to understand URL structure.
2. Scrape key pages: homepage, product/service pages, pricing, docs, blog, about, and high-value landing pages.
3. Extract title tags, meta descriptions, headings, internal links, content structure, canonical signals when visible, and image alt text when available.
4. Search target keywords when provided; scrape top ranking pages for comparison.

## Parallel Work

If appropriate, use sub-agents or equivalent parallel task runners:

- Site Structure: URL patterns, sitemap health, internal linking, orphan/broken pages.
- On-Page SEO: titles, meta descriptions, H1/H2 hierarchy, content quality.
- Keyword And SERP: target keywords, ranking pages, competitor page patterns.
- Technical Issues: broken links, duplicate content signals, missing metadata.
