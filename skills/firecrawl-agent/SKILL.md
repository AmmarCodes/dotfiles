description: |
  AI-powered autonomous data extraction that navigates complex sites and returns structured JSON. Use this skill when the user wants structured data from websites, needs to extract pricing tiers, product listings, directory entries, or any data as JSON with a schema. Triggers on "extract structured data", "get all the products", "pull pricing info", "extract as JSON", or when the user provides a JSON schema for website data. More powerful than simple scraping for multi-page structured extraction.

# firecrawl agent

AI-powered autonomous extraction. The agent navigates sites and extracts structured data (takes 2-5 minutes).

## When to use

- You need structured data from complex multi-page sites
- Manual scraping would require navigating many pages
- You want the AI to figure out where the data lives

## Quick start

```bash
# Extract structured data
firecrawl agent "extract all pricing tiers" --wait -o .firecrawl/pricing.json

# With a JSON schema for structured output
firecrawl agent "extract products" --schema '{"type":"object","properties":{"name":{"type":"string"},"price":{"type":"number"}}}' --wait -o .firecrawl/products.json

# Focus on specific pages
firecrawl agent "get feature list" --urls "<url>" --wait -o .firecrawl/features.json
```

## Options

| Option                 | Description                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `--urls <urls>`        | Starting URLs for the agent               |
| `--model <model>`      | Model to use: spark-1-mini or spark-1-pro |
| `--schema <json>`      | JSON schema for structured output         |
| `--schema-file <path>` | Path to JSON schema file                  |
| `--max-credits <n>`    | Credit limit for this agent run           |
| `--wait`               | Wait for agent to complete                |
| `--pretty`             | Pretty print JSON output                  |
| `-o, --output <path>`  | Output file path                          |

## Tips

- Always use `--wait` to get results inline. Without it, returns a job ID.
- Use `--schema` for predictable, structured output — otherwise the agent returns freeform data.
- Agent runs consume more credits than simple scrapes. Use `--max-credits` to cap spending.
- For simple single-page extraction, prefer `scrape` — it's faster and cheaper.
