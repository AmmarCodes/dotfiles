# Firecrawl Lead Research

Use this to create a concise, actionable pre-meeting brief.

## Onboarding Interview

Infer the company, person, meeting context, and desired brief depth from context. If the company is clear, proceed immediately.

Ask at most 1-3 concise questions only if blocked, such as the company/person to research or the meeting context.

## Firecrawl Collection Plan

Use Firecrawl search and scrape to gather:

- company website, about, product, pricing, careers, team, and customer pages
- recent news, funding, launches, hiring, partnerships, and press
- public person profiles, talks, posts, interviews, and role/background
- relevant industry context and likely business challenges

## Parallel Work

If appropriate, use sub-agents or equivalent parallel task runners:

- Company Profile researcher
- Recent News and Activity researcher
- Person researcher
- Industry/Pain Point researcher

Each researcher should return source URLs and only evidence-backed claims.
