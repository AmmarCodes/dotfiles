# Humanizer

[![skills.sh installs](https://skills.sh/b/blader/humanizer)](https://skills.sh/blader/humanizer)

A portable agent skill that removes signs of AI-generated writing from text, making it sound more natural and human. It is plain Markdown, so it can run in any harness that supports skill-style instructions.

## Installation

### Skills CLI

Install globally with the cross-agent skills CLI so Humanizer is available in every project:

```bash
npx skills add blader/humanizer --global
```

Update an existing install:

```bash
npx skills update humanizer --global
```

To install globally into every supported agent harness:

```bash
npx skills add blader/humanizer --global --agent '*'
```

To target one configured harness, pass its agent name:

```bash
npx skills add blader/humanizer --global --agent <agent-name>
```

Omit `--global` for a project-local install that can be committed and shared with collaborators. Start a new agent session or reload skills after installation.

### Claude Code plugin

Claude Code users can also install Humanizer as a plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add blader/humanizer
/plugin install humanizer@humanizer
```

The skill is then invoked as `/humanizer:humanizer`.

### Manual

Any agent harness can use the skill directly because the runtime artifact is `SKILL.md`. Install it wherever your harness expects skill directories, or copy `SKILL.md` into an existing skill folder.

For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blader/humanizer.git /path/to/your/skills/humanizer
```

Or, if you already have this repo cloned:

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/your/skills/humanizer
cp SKILL.md /path/to/your/skills/humanizer/
```

## Usage

Invoke the skill however your agent harness exposes installed skills. Common forms include a slash command or a direct request:

```
/humanizer

[paste your text here]
```

```
Please humanize this text: [your text]
```

Point it at a file and the skill rewrites it in place:

```
Humanize the prose in docs/launch-post.md
```

### Voice Calibration

To match your personal writing style, provide a sample of your own writing:

```
/humanizer

Here's a sample of my writing for voice matching:
[paste 2-3 paragraphs of your own writing]

Now humanize this text:
[paste AI text to humanize]
```

The skill will analyze your sentence rhythm, word choices, and quirks, then apply them to the rewrite instead of producing generic "clean" output.

## Overview

Based on [Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing) guide, maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup. This comprehensive guide comes from observations of thousands of instances of AI-generated text.

The skill also includes a final "obviously AI generated" audit pass and a second rewrite, to catch lingering AI-isms in the first draft.

Rewrites follow a no-fabrication rule: they never add facts, names, dates, or citations that aren't in the source text. Specificity has to come from the source or the author, not from the rewrite.

### Key Insight from Wikipedia

> "LLMs use statistical algorithms to guess what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases."

## Full Example

*(Illustration note: the rewrite below adds specifics, like the month and the neighborhoods, that stand in for details the author would supply. In a real session those come from the user; the skill asks rather than invents.)*

**Before (AI-sounding):**
> I recently spent five unforgettable days in Lisbon, and let me tell you — this city completely stole my heart. From the moment I arrived, I knew I was somewhere truly special.
>
> Nestled along the banks of the Tagus River, Lisbon stands as a vibrant testament to Portugal's enduring spirit, where rich history and modern energy intertwine at every turn. Yes, the famous hills are challenging — my legs certainly felt it! — but every climb rewards you with breathtaking, panoramic views that make it all worthwhile.
>
> No trip would be complete without riding the iconic Tram 28, winding through the city's most historic neighborhoods. And the food? Simply divine. The original pastéis de nata at Pastéis de Belém are a beloved national treasure, and savoring one still warm was a moment I will never forget.
>
> But what truly makes Lisbon special isn't just the sights — it's the feeling. Wander a few steps off the main squares and you'll discover a quieter, more authentic side: sun-drenched alleys, charming tiled facades, and friendly locals going about their daily lives, inviting you to slow down and savor every moment.
>
> Of course, the must-see São Jorge Castle offers stunning views over the rooftops below. The queues can be long, but the experience is absolutely worth it for any history buff or curious traveler.
>
> Would I go back? Absolutely. Lisbon isn't just a place to visit — it's a place to fall in love with, again and again. If you're dreaming of your next getaway, this is one destination that promises memories to last a lifetime. ✨

**After (Humanized):**
> I spent five days in Lisbon last October and still have mixed feelings about it. Beautiful, yes. Also harder on the knees than anyone warned me.
>
> The hills are the whole story and somehow never make the brochures. My hotel was up in Alfama, which photographs beautifully and translates, in practice, to climbing what felt like a six-story staircase every time I wanted coffee. By the second day my calves had opinions. I started planning each walk around which way was downhill, which is a strange way to see a city but probably an honest one.
>
> Everyone says to ride Tram 28, so I did, wedged against a stranger's backpack for forty minutes while three tour groups filmed the same corner. I would walk the route next time, or go before breakfast. The custard tarts, though, earn the fuss. I had one at a plain little place in Graça, still warm, and for about thirty seconds I understood why people build trips around pastry.
>
> What I did not expect was how quiet the city gets away from the main squares. Two blocks uphill from any plaza it turns into laundry lines, chipped tile, open windows, and old men watching football with the sound turned up. That is the Lisbon I keep thinking about, not the castle.
>
> The castle is fine. The view is great, the queue is long, and I spent more time shuffling toward the entrance than looking at anything once I got inside. If I had only two days, I would trade it for an afternoon of getting lost.
>
> I would go back, but in spring and with better shoes. Lisbon does not bend over backward to make things easy for you. I think I liked that, even when my legs disagreed.

## Version History

- **2.9.1** - Improved distribution and portability: removed nonportable frontmatter and tool preapprovals, made global installation the documented default, added package validation, and removed the duplicated long-form example from the runtime prompt. No change to the 33 patterns.
- **2.9.0** - Added a no-fabrication rule: rewrites may not invent facts, names, dates, or citations not present in the source, and every example that modeled invented specifics was re-cut to use only source information (fixes #187). Replaced paragraph-count parity with an information-over-shape rule, made a user's voice sample outrank the em dash ban, and added invocation modes (pasted text / file / embedded).
