      ### Refinement / Weighting
      <!--
      Ready for development means replying yes to the following questions:

      - Does the issue have a problem statement in the description?
      - Does the issue have the expected behavior described well enough for anyone to understand?
      - Does the issue explicitly define who the stakeholders are (e.g. BE, FE, PM, UX and/or Tech Writer)?
      - Does the issue have a proposal in the description?
      - Does the issue have proper labeling matching the job to be done? (e.g. bug, feature, performance)
      - Is this issue sufficiently small enough? If not, break it into smaller issues
      - Is it assigned to the correct domain (e.g. frontend, backend)? If not, break it into two issues for the respective domains
      â€“ Is the issue clear and easy to understand? If not, try asking further clarification questions and update the description once they are received

      If more than 2 MRs are needed, consider adding a table like the following to the description (e.g. under `Implementation plan`).

      | Description | MR |
      |-|-|
      |||

      It will help track the status.
      -->

      - [ ] Ready for development
      - [ ] Weight is assigned
      - [ ] Number of MRs listed
      - [ ] Needs testing considerations
      - [ ] Needs documentation updates

      **Reasoning:**

      <!--
      Add some initial thoughts on how you might break down this issue. A bulleted list is fine.

      This will likely require the code changes similar to the following:

      - replace the hex driver with a sonic screwdriver
      - rewrite backups to magnetic tape
      - send up semaphore flags to warn others

      Links to previous examples. Discussions on prior art. Notice examples of the simplicity/complexity in the proposed designs.
      -->

      <details>
        <summary>Estimated weight</summary>
        <code>?</code>

      If we are aligned on the weight, we can apply:

      ```
      /label ~"workflow::ready for development" ~"estimation::completed"
      /unlabel ~"needs weight"
      /weight ?
      ```
